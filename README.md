## Introduction

KrishMitra-2.0 is a web application designed to assist farmers by providing intelligent crop recommendations. The application leverages soil data and real-time weather forecasts to suggest the most suitable crops for a given location, aiming to enhance agricultural productivity and profitability. The user-friendly interface supports multiple languages (English, Hindi, and Telugu) and delivers detailed, AI-driven reports on crop suitability, soil compatibility, and climate appropriateness.

## Features

  * **Crop Recommendation:** Utilizes a machine learning model to predict the best crops based on soil nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), pH, and weather conditions (temperature, humidity, rainfall).
  * **Weather Integration:** Fetches real-time weather data and a 10-day forecast from the WeatherAPI to provide accurate, location-based recommendations.
  * **AI-Powered Reports:** Employs the Gemini API to generate detailed and insightful reports, offering a comprehensive analysis of why a particular crop is recommended.
  * **Multi-language Support:** The user interface can be switched between English, Hindi, and Telugu for broader accessibility.
  * **GPS Location:** Allows users to automatically fetch their location data for easier input.

## Tech Stack

  * **Backend:** Flask
  * **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy
  * **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  * **APIs:** Google Gemini API, WeatherAPI

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tangudu-amar/KrishMitra-2.0.git
    cd KrishMitra-2.0
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up API keys:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:

    ```
    WEATHER_API_KEY="your_weather_api_key"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage

1.  Navigate to the home page and select the "Crop Recommendation" option.
2.  Enter the required details, such as land area, previous crop, and location (state and district). You can also use the "Use My GPS Location" button to automatically fill in the latitude and longitude.
3.  Click "Get Recommendation" to submit the form.
4.  The application will process the data and display the top recommended crops along with a detailed report generated by the Gemini API.

## API Keys

  * **WeatherAPI:** Used to fetch current weather and forecast data. You can get a free API key from [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/).
  * **Gemini API:** Used to generate detailed, human-like reports for crop recommendations. You can obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
